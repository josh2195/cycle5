## Major: Information Systems

This project relates to my major because help desk tickets are a critical part in helping the user experience. The tickets also need to be stored and able to be seen by the user so they can get updates.

## Purpose

This website is for students at CCU to submit help desk tickets. They have the option to choose whether their issue is related to their computer, Moodle, Webadvisor, or an other category. They are also required to give a description to assist the IT team in sovling their problem promptly.

## Usage

- Navigate to the website
- Create your accound
- Create your ticket
- View your ticket for updates
- Logout

## Future Development

I would like to add a live chat system. I am not great with JavaScript and JQuery at the moment so I could not do this yet. I also do not have another person to check the live chat to make sure it works.

## Dependencies

None
